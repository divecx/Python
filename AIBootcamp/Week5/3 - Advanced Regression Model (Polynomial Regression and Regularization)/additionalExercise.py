# 1. vary regularization parameter:
#         - experiment with different values of alpha (e.g., 0.1, 1, 10) for ridge and lasso regression
#         - observe how the model's coefficients and performance change

# 2. use multiple features:
#         - include more features(e.g., HouseAge, AveRooms) and observe the impact on model performance
        
# 3. Feature importance with lasso:
#         - use lasso regression to perform feature selection and identify the most relevant predictor
