# # Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# # Steps in EDA
# # 1. Data Cleaning
# # 2. Data Transformation
# # 3. Aggregation and Filtering

# # Identifying Pattern, Trends, and Correlations
# # Visual tools for insight:
# 1. line plots for trends over time 
# 2. bar charts for categorical comparisons 
# 3. scatter plots for relationships 
# 4. heatmaps for correlation analysis

# # Key Patterns to look for:
# 1. relationships between variables (correlations)
# 2. distribution of variables (histogram, boxplot)
# 3. outliers or anomalies
